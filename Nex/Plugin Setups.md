## Nex Nostalgia
A plugin from the plugin-hub that implements the voice lines from Nex as they appeared in RS3. Use of the plugin is completely optional, but it may greatly help a players situational awareness to be able to "hear" her specials and phase changes, instead of having to monitor her overhead text or pay attention to public chat.
#### Settings:
Volume Gain: Ranges from `-25` to `+6` . Should be set pretty low, in the negative tens, as the voice line are very loud by default

## Radius Markers
You may have seen these before, radius markers are a powerful plugin that allows us to mark boxes around NPC's according to a variety of useful parameters. Specifically for Nex, this allows us to mark her max aggression range, to allow us to move outside her aggro range strategically. Additionally, it also allows us to visualize the radius of her blood sacrifice attack so that we know how far to run if we are marked for blood sacrifice. You will see multiple radius markers to import here which will allow you to see these radii as Nex changes forms throughout the fight.
